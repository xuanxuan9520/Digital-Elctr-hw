# Week 2 Homework 

Intereting Project

I am interested in the project Arduino-Controlled Robotic Drum. The related link is https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Controlled-Robotic-Drum/

This project uses Arduino to make a robotic drum. The drum stick is connected to the Arduino. After the Arduino is connected to the computer, the user can control the movement of the drum stick through computer operation, which can accelerate or decelerate. 

In my opinion, the invention of robotic drum has a huge impact on the interaction between human and the drum. In the past, people controlled the drumsticks with their hands, but when using robotic drums, people do not have direct contact with the drum, which means that they control the drum through the computer and Arduino. The computer and Arduino are a new kind of medium, a new manpower. When the way people interact with the drum changes, the design of the drum and drumsticks might change accordingly such as the form and material design, which may be a huge change. 

In addition, for beginners, the process of learning to play drums might be greatly simplified because of the invention of robotic drums. It may happen that beginners can play drums as long as they are able to control the keyboard.
